- 👋 Hi, I’m @mattpinoy
- 👀 I’m interested in artistic cultures from dance, music, self-expression, and of course, gaming, among others.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning what my future holds in the world of technology, while pursuing full-stack development and javascript. I'm currently completing my UX-Design Certification (provided by Google) and enrolling myself in the Odin Project to begin my coding journey.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that allow growth within all parties, while constantly strengthening my skills in the field. I love being able to contribute to great causes and am genuinely interested in passion projects that people believe in. The scale of the project matters less than the goal, and I want to see goals and dreams realized.
- 📫 How to reach me \\ best is via email <mattv.mejia@outlook.com> or by visiting my website <mattvmejia.com> currently in development.
